Problems/Missing features:
- My delete feature only sends you back to the forum when done, but would be more convenient to send you back to where you were.
- I removed the edit page because of a last minute issue with file corruption.
- the delete feature doesn't work on forums, another file corruption. (both corruption issues easy, but time consuming. I figured you'd know i know how to work it by the post delete feature.)
- There is no add topic page, but I sorta wanted the admin only to be able to do so, and I can do that via Php MyAdmin anyway.
- I also forgot to credit the open source WYSIWYG text editor I used, CK editor.

-ckeditor refuses to load custom config.js or myConfig files no matter what.
	-for now just setting the options when i replace the textarea.

-Still some minor formatting issues with text. Possibly fix:
	I realized i am using nl2br so I don't need line breaks.
	One fix was display:none; on the br tag for the posts, with entermode p. The only issue is that it looks different in the editor.
	Later try changing it so the echo is no longer nl2br.

-May need to check what happens if people have noscript enabled.

THE GRAPHICS ERROR IS A WHITE SPACE ISSSUE! FIX IT WITH CSS!

Possibly fixed:
- I also did not include my edit file, because I found an issue last minute. 
- I also didn't adapt for resolutions bigger than mine, so the background looks off. Mine is 1280 by 800. 
- My log in checking system is not case-sensitive, so when you type lowercase for an uppercase user name, it logs you in, but you don't get the options for deleting or editing. 

NOTE: applied following:
	I needed to generate an SSH KEY, found out how from:
	    https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys
    Also i changed around the urls used for origin in the config
    used to be:
    	url = https://git@github.com/jvandeus/forum.git
    now it is:
    	url = ssh://git@github.com:jvandeus/forum.git
