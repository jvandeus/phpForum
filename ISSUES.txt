Problems/Missing features:
- My delete feature only sends you back to the forum when done, but would be more convenient to send you back to where you were.
- I removed the edit page because of a last minute issue with file corruption.
- the delete feature doesn't work on forums, another file corruption. (both corruption issues easy, but time consuming. I figured you'd know i know how to work it by the post delete feature.)
- There is no add topic page, but I sorta wanted the admin only to be able to do so, and I can do that via Php MyAdmin anyway.
- I also forgot to credit the open source WYSIWYG text editor I used, CK editor.

-ckeditor refuses to load custom config.js or myConfig files no matter what.
	-for now just setting the options when i replace the textarea.

-Still some minor formatting issues with text. Possibly fix:
	I realized i am using nl2br so I don't need line breaks.
	One fix was display:none; on the br tag for the posts, with entermode p. The only issue is that it looks different in the editor.
	Later try changing it so the echo is no longer nl2br.

-May need to check what happens if people have noscript enabled.

Possibly fixed:
- I also did not include my edit file, because I found an issue last minute. 
- I also didn't adapt for resolutions bigger than mine, so the background looks off. Mine is 1280 by 800. 
- My log in checking system is not case-sensitive, so when you type lowercase for an uppercase user name, it logs you in, but you don't get the options for deleting or editing.
- Small gaps like the one in the header tables was sort of solved by display: block; in images.
	Downside is that to display centered, you have to apply auto margins such as #title and #title img in the CSS.
	Other way is to make the return the "display: block;" to "display: inline;" or something similar. http://www.impressivewebs.com/default-css-display-values-html-elements/
	img by default is inline.
- Note, keep an eye on the title section in the header. Make browser compatability is not an issue, mess with the css.
	It may not be flexible right now, so if i want to make that vertically resizable, like ckeditor, I may want to mess with the dimensions and 
	the margins and padding.

NOTE: applied following:
	I needed to generate an SSH KEY, found out how from:
	    https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys
    Also i changed around the urls used for origin in the config
    used to be:
    	url = https://git@github.com/jvandeus/forum.git
    now it is:
    	url = ssh://git@github.com:jvandeus/forum.git
    	
<!-- NOTES: 
	I need to make sure there is an error page for stuff like when there are no posts in a topic
	or when there are no topics. 
	Also make sure blank posts are not allowed to be entered
	Make an error page that with also accept error messages via the GET method.
	Add a "last edited" thing to posts.
	Check to make sure the page is valid for content showing.
	Check to see if the id is valid for content showing.-->
