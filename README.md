An attempt at repairing and improving the code for a forum i have been working on during my education

This project intended to create a base code to design forums for myself and potential employees and clients. I provided all code and graphics with the exception of ckeditor.
I used ckeditor for my input sections so i could focus on other aspects of the site, while preventing any kind of SQL injection. If time permits, this will be replaced with my own code as well.

For now, current issues are listed in an issues.txt file. Once all or most of these are repaired, I will do more housekeeping and likely include the issues into this readme.

I will include installation and preview instructions when I feel i have repaired enough for it to more functional than my previous forum code posted on my personal website.
